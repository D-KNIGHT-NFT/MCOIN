    The Shaman

    Also known as medicine men/women or healers, Shamans help other people heal on a Soul level. As a person who resonates the most with the Shaman archetype, you are highly intuitive, perceptive, and energy conscious. You are an Empath who can tune into the subtle energy present in other people, places, animals, and nature forms.

    As an earthy and sensuous person, you are able to feel and engage with the Soul of the earth, the Soul of animals, and the Soul of other human beings. Deep within you, there is the urge to heal other people of their ailments, whether they be physical, emotional, mental or spiritual.

    You feel the most at home in nature, where the presence of the Divine can be felt clearly. As an outsider, you notice things other people don’t seem to notice or care about. This perceptivity allows you to instantly understand what is wrong in a person or place. At your core, you feel like a child of the earth who feels the most spiritually fulfilled when you’re helping others find health and wholeness again.

    Shadow Side:

    The dark side of the Shaman temperament can manifest as a tendency to sell their gifts to the highest bidder solely for monetary gain, become spiritually abusive towards the vulnerable and sick, and egotistically inflated to an intense degree. Shamans who don’t learn how to let go of their egos will struggle with narcissistic God Complexes. Creating spiritual co-dependency in those who come to them for healing (instead of encouraging self-empowerment), is another potential dark trait of the Shaman.

    Strengths:

    These strengths are developed when you’re open, aware, and internally balanced.

    Spiritual Purpose: To heal other beings and restore them to health.

    Existential Fear: To be possessed by dark forces, to be dangerous to others, to lose one’s gift of healing.
